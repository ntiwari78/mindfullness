# 1. What are the central characteristics of mindfulness that are revealed by the stereotype of the scientist?
The scientist represents the modern tendency to operationalize and instrumentalize mindfulness, either as a neurophysiological phenomenon or as a psychotherapeutic protocol. The scientist is fundamentally interested in experimentation that produces an objective evidence base for claims about the efficaciousness of mindfulness in various ways. For the scientist, the meaning of mindfulness emerges from this evidentiary base; there is no originary or 'real' meaning other than what is revealed through experiment and observation. In practice, of course, not all scientists conform to only the stereotype of the scientist -- people are complicated!

# 2. What are the central characteristics of mindfulness that are revealed by the stereotype of the monk? 
In contrast with the scientist, the monk represents a more spiritual and reverential approach to mindfulness, seeing it as a means of self-cultivation, self-transformation, and practice. The monk is fundamentally interested in the way that the practice of mindfulness seems to transform the practitioner, enabling them to reside in more compassionate space, opening doors to deeper levels of self-reflection and ethical development. At the same time, the monk sees mindfulness as a way to address the general and universal problem of suffering in the world. Genuine or real mindfulness is described in ancient texts, and we come to understand the true meaning of those texts only through our subjective practice in the present. In practice, of course, not all monks conform to only the stereotype of the monk -- people are complicated!

# 3. What are the central characteristics of mindfulness that are revealed by the stereotype of the ninja?
The ninja represents a vision of mindfulness as a technique to cultivate discipline, awareness, and skill. The ninja is fundamentally interested in the way that the continued practice of mindfulness meditation seems to enhance concentration and focus, and leads to greater mental tranquility, thus enhancing his/her ability to perform intricate skills with calm discipline. At the same time, the ninja represents the hope that advanced cultivation will lead to the development of superhuman skills and abilities. For the ninja, the seeds of genuine or real mindfulness is found in ancient texts, but understanding these seeds requires that a student practice for themselves under the guidance of an accomplished teacher. In practice, of course, not all ninja conform to only the stereotype of the ninja -- people are complicated!

# 4. What are the central characteristics of mindfulness that are revealed by the stereotype of the zombie?
The zombie represents the fear that mindfulness is really a way to tranquilize people into docility and acceptance. That is, the zombie unifies mindfulness with mindlessness. Unlike the monk and the ninja, who see mindfulness as a way to enhance positive aspects of life and reduce suffering, the zombie embodies the idea that mindfulness actually prevents people from taking control of their lives and acting positively in the world. Instead of acting, the zombie just accepts things as they are. Instead of doing something, the zombie just is. The mindfulness zombie is the nightmare of a 'zero-level' of human existence. In practice, of course, not all zombies conform to only the stereotype of the zombie -- people (even zombies) are complicated!
